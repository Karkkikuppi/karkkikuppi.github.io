                <p class="blog-post-meta">Project released: May 8th, 2022</p>
                <p>Godisbot was the first Twitter bot I ever made. And apparently like the only good concept I had for one, because i made like 6 of them just for fun.</p>
                <p>In this post, I'll explain how it worked.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>How do you even create an AI that replicates one's behavior? Well, in an age before ChatGPT, I had to embark on a research adventure.</p>
                <img src="../img/godisbot/ai-is-hard.png" alt="Photo of some interesting search results" class="img-fluid" style="width: 50%">
                <p><br>Somehow, I hadn't actually realized that what I was doing was pretty difficult. Especially when I didn't have <i>any</i> experience working with AI.
                Thanfully there's a lot of smart people out there! After a while, I stumbled into <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Recurrent Neural Networks</a>.
                This tech would allow me to create the first version of Godisbot. </p>
                <h2>The How</h2>
                <p>Now, I had to get a dataset of Godis' tweets. I used <a href="https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets">this</a> free tool to download all the tweets (sidenote: the app had to shut down following Musk's Twitter botcalypse)
                to an excel file, which I then parsed using a python script.</p>
                <p>After that, the data had to be parsed to remove all @mentions. I didn't want the bot to be really annoying.</p>
                <p>Now, to the training! I found a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation">tutorial</a> on how to generate text using RNN.
                I trained the model on Google Colab, and dumped like 1000 tweets into a text file. I thought that hosting the model with the bot was an inefficient way to do it, so I just dumped the tweets into a text file.</p>
                <p>And then, I launched it. What followed was a series of embarassing technical failures that caused the bot to tweet out duplicate tweets, tweet at the wrong times, and sometimes it just wouldn't do anything. For days at a time.</p>
                <p>I kept maintaining the bot, but I didn't really care that much about improving it. It was a technical nightmare, and I just didn't see any point in re-doing it.</p>
                <h2>Godisbot v2</h2>
                <p>Godisbot's tweets were really wacky. They didn't really resemble godis' tweets, but they were funny nevertheless. But that was about to change. </p>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ahmetlacksdpmn">Ahmet</a>, dubbed by some as "The Best Person Ever", introduced me to Markov Chains.</p>
                <img src="../img/godisbot/legendary-hero-comes-in-for-the-save.png" alt="Ahmet introduces me to markov chains" style="width: 100%">
                <p><br>This was a <i>game changer.</i> After implementing the changes, godisbot as we know it was born.</p>

                <p><br>After this, I created a <i>couple</i> spin-offs for my friends. But yeah. That's about it i think. And everyone lived happily ever after. jk i just shut them all down at some point</p>
